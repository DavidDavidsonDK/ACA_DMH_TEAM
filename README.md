Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Here presented three learning algorithms.
	Logistic Regression
	Disicion Tree
	Random Forest

After evaluation of each algorithm we compare their mean accurancy
