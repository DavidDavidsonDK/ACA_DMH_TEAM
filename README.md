Here is a code for Desicion Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regresiion
These models use the same data for testing and training
putting all together
Decision Tree Accuracy =  0.746153846154  ( 0.0624926031126 )
Random Forest Tree Accuracy =  0.823076923077  ( 0.0713355268884 )
Logistic Reg. Accuracy =  0.819230769231  ( 0.0689095110276 )
